    "The battery specification does not contain a discharge profile, which is unusual.The battery characteristics critical to charging are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Li-Ion Chemistry\n",
    "* 500 mAh Capacity (4.2 V â†’ 3.0 V, 0.2 C normalized discharge current)\n",
    "* 4.2 V Charge Voltage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Genesis Charging Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The charger implements the following charge profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Constant Current Mode\n",
    "    * 247 mA\n",
    "    * V<sub>BAT</sub>3.0V - 4.1V\n",

    "    * V<sub>BAT</sub>=4.1 V\n",
    "    * I<sub>TERM</sub>=24.7 mA\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the charging voltage is reduced from the specification in an effort to improve the battery life.\n",

    "I am using the Keithley 2401 for my test automation target. Its RS232 port is configured as follows:\n",
